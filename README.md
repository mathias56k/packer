# Software Packager

#### Description
This is a project that I am keen to make to automate a little bit of my work.
Every month we update software on SCCM and until now we have been doing it by hand, checking what is new and then downloading and packaging the software takes about (1-2) days. Would like to make it a max 1h process.

#### Plan & Progress
- [X] Make the program show if there is a newer version than we have deployed
- [ ] Make the current version variables changeable by hand and somehow maybe automate them by keeping the feature to change by hand
- [ ] Make it possible to get a list of updates with newest versions to be saved to a .txt file
- [ ] Make it possible to download needed files with a press of a button from the program
- [ ] Package the files and make changes in PowerShell scripts automatically
